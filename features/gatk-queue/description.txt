Queue is a pipelining system built to work natively with GATK as well as other high-throughput sequence analysis software. Its user documentation is hosted in the [GATK forum](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/categories/queue). Note that the Queue package includes the GATK within the Queue executable, so you do not need to download GATK separately if you plan to run GATK exclusively through Queue.
